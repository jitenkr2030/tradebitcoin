# 🪙 **SIP in Bitcoin - Comprehensive Feature Specification**

## 📋 **OVERVIEW**

### **What is SIP in Bitcoin?**
SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) in Bitcoin is a disciplined investment approach that allows users to invest a fixed amount in Bitcoin at regular intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly), regardless of market price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility through **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)** and builds wealth systematically over time.

### **Why Use SIP in Bitcoin?**
- **🎯 Disciplined Investing**: Removes emotional decision-making from crypto investments
- **📈 Rupee Cost Averaging**: Reduces average purchase price over time
- **💰 Small Amounts**: Start with as little as ₹100 per investment
- **⏰ Automated**: Set it and forget it - no manual intervention needed
- **🛡️ Risk Reduction**: Spreads investment risk across different market conditions
- **🇮🇳 India-Focused**: Designed for Indian investors with INR support
